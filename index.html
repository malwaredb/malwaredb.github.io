		The Malware Database (MalwareDB) is a project which maintains the bookkeeping of malicious and benign files to aid malware researchers, cybersecurity analysts, forensic investigators, and anyone else who finds themself with a lot of malware or unknown on their hands. The main objectives:
		<ul>
			<li>Store the samples in a centralized manner for members of the team to retrieve.</li>
			<li>Use similarity hashes to find similarities between samples, which <i>may</i> be previously unknown relationships.</li>
			<li>Categorize and organize the data by customizable hierarchical labels, to make it easy to develop your own queryable taxonomy for your dataset.</li>
			<li>To be cross-platform and scalable.</li>
			<li>Development of some of the core functionality in such a way that they're usable in other projects.</li>
			<li>Written in Rust for memory safety and speed, with unit tests & dependency management.</li>
		</ul>
		The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/malwaredb/malwaredb-rs">Github</a>. There's also an experimental <a href="https://github.com/malwaredb/docker">Dockerfile</a>.
