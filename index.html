		The Malware Database (MalwareDB) is a project which maintains the bookkeeping of malicious and benign files to aid malware researchers, cybersecurity analysts, forensic investigators, and anyone else who finds themself with a lot of malware or unknown on their hands. The main objectives:
		<ul>
			<li>Store the samples in a centralised manner for members of the team to retrieve.</li>
			<li>Use similarity hashes to find similarities between samples, and explore previously unknown connections.</li>
			<li>Categorise and organise the data by customisable tags and labels, to make it easier to control how data is shared or not shared.</li>
			<li>To be cross-platform and scalable.</li>
			<li>Development of some of the core functionality in such a way that they're usable in other projects.</li>
		</ul>
		The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/malwaredb">Github</a>.
